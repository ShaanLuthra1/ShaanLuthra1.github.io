## Methane Gas Leak Detection

##### PrecisionHawk | Data Scientist
**Business Problem:** Oil and Gas Factories can have methane gas leaking out of components. This is damaging to the environment and also incredibly costly to companies. I built a detector for Methane Gas Plumes

**Solution Highlights:** 
  * Built Methane Gas Leak Detector pipeline including preprocessing, feature extraction, model architecture, and inference. Created Video Stabilization model to correct drone camera jitters and movements. Leveraged Optical Flow feature matching with Affine and Homography transforms to achieve precise video alignment.
  * Refactored core Object Detection Deep Learning Model (YOLO architecture, PyTorch) and reintegrated all dependencies after 1+ year leading to an mAP increase of 5%. Integrated Bayesian hyperparameter optimization to updated model.  
  * Developed Aerial-based oriented bounding box modeling for Object Detection Model, leading to an increase of 8% in Intersection over Union (IOU).  
  * Implemented Distributed Data caching using custom Samplers enabling parallel GPU computing. Leads to substantial reduction of computational expenses for model training.
