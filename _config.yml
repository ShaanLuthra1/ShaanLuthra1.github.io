  I am a Machine Learning Engineer with a proven track record of building entire model pipelines and deploying production-ready scalable systems.
  <br><br>
  I have successfully led numerous projects where I spearheaded the entire lifecycle of model development, collaborating closely with engineering teams to ensure seamless integration with existing infrastructure.
  <br><br>
  I have a deep understanding of statistical models and can recognize various architectures and transformations needed to fit different data sources. This combined with my extensive experience  with frameworks such as TensorFlow, and PyTorch, enables me to effectively implement state-of-the-art models and deliver scalable solutions.
  <br><br>
  I have consistently taken on leadership roles in previous projects and jobs, coordinating with stakeholders, mentoring junior team members, and fostering a collaborative and results-oriented work environment.  <br><br>
